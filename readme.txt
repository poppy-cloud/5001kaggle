Readme


I used python in the Pycharm. And I have two python files. One is the data_process.py and the other is predict.py. (the predice.py call the function data_process.py)

I used pandas, xgboost package and csv packages.

If you want to reproduce the result, run the predict.py and you can get the finalresult.csv, which is identical to my final submission.
